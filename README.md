This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Grocery Search Engine
- I always have a hard time comparing price of the different grocery items from store to store, so I created this app so I can personally use it to search for groceries and compare prizes before I make a trip out to the store. 


## Features
- Search Engine with products from [store names]

## Roadmap
- I would like to be able to enable login for users that wants to add items to their shopping list

## ToDo:

* Initial thoughts:

Initial MVP - No need to write my own REST API but instead I am using sheet.bet to privde this layer

Frontend:
- [ ] Build frontend prototype without styles
- [ ] basic search
- [ ] GET data from api 
- [ ] filter out data that's not needed
- [ ] display results of search in a list (using React)
- [ ] Simple Styling of the components to make it look good

Script for Scraping
- [ ] Use Cheerio and Axios to scrape data from a Save on Foods
- [ ] Once data is scraped, post to Google Sheets api


Once the basic building block is working, now build the RESTAPI to move away from Excel sheet

- [ ] Detemine the structure of db
- [ ] Create python script to scrape data from grocery store sites
- [ ] Research and see if there's anything existing
- [ ] Check some sample data on excel spreadsheet and use it in app
