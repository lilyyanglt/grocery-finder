This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Grocery Search Engine
- I always have a hard time comparing price of the different grocery items from store to store, so I created this app so I can personally use it to search for groceries and compare prizes before I make a trip out to the store. 


## Features
- Search Engine with products from [store names]

## Roadmap
- I would like to be able to enable login for users that wants to add items to their shopping list

## ToDo:

* Initial thoughts:

- [ ] Build frontend prototype without styles
- [ ] Write a python program that scrapes data into a database
- [ ] Front-end fetches from the database endpoint
- [ ] Populate the database (excel)
  - [ ] Detemine the structure of db
  - [ ] Create python script to scrape data from grocery store sites
  - [ ] Research and see if there's anything existing
  - [ ] Check some sample data on excel spreadsheet and use it in app
